## TODO

- [ ] allow specifying IPs as the hostname
- [ ] register as a URL handler automatically?
- [ ] show download progress (X of Y) in addition to speed
- [ ] audit error-handling
- [ ] add-task button in popup (fetch .torrent file/allow force-download-as-.torrent-file-for-if-the-URL-is-mangled option; allow other protocols like FTP or <video> elements too)
- [ ] change icon for notification
- [ ] auto-re-login if `sid` is out of date
- [ ] determine how to merge `browser.d.ts` and `DefinitelyTyped/chrome` (which has a different shape, specifically, around Promises v. callbacks)
- [ ] should background task notify if there is no username/password set?
- [ ] fix notification interval setting to not require blur
- [ ] when deleting tasks, the UI removes two from the list (!)
- [ ] group error message by API group name
